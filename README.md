## Building from source
You need to have an appropriate Android SDK, its platform tools and gradle installed.
To create an APK you need to [create a keystore](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3997748/how-can-i-create-a-keystore).

Execute the following commands with your keystore and key information.

```bash
export PACK_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD="yourpassword"
export PACK_KEYSTORE_ALIAS="keyalias"
export PACK_KEYSTORE_KEY_PASSWORD="keypswd"
gradle build
```

If there was no error you can find the APK in the directory `build/outputs/apk`.
